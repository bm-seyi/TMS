# Tram Management System - API

## Description

This project is an ASP.NET application that utilizes SignalR for real-time communication with a Transportation Management System (TMS) application built using .NET MAUI. SignalR is used to provide seamless and low-latency data exchange between the backend ASP.NET server and the TMS mobile app, enabling features like real-time updates, notifications, and bidirectional communication.

## Features
- **Scalable SignalR Hub:** SignalR hub configured to handle multiple simultaneous connections, supporting large-scale communication needs.
- **Customizable APIs:** REST APIs can be easily added to the backend to complement SignalR communication, allowing for additional functionality such as data retrieval or submission.

## Roadmap
- **SignalR Integration:** Completed integration of SignalR on both the ASP.NET backend and the TMS mobile app.
- **Backend API:** Basic setup of SignalR hub and backend API endpoints.
